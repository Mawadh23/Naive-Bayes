# Naive-Bayes
Project Overview:
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of Naive Bayes classification using a dataset. The goal is to predict outcomes based on the input features provided in the dataset.

Included Files:

naive_bayes_classification.ipynb: A Notebook containing Python code that loads the dataset, trains a Naive Bayes model, and evaluates its performance using accuracy and classification metrics.

Dataset:
The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which is available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-)

How to Use:
Install Required Libraries:
Make sure to install the necessary libraries by running the following command:
pip install pandas scikit-learn

Running the Naive Bayes Code:
The code is in the naive_bayes_classification.ipynb notebook. You can run the notebook in any Jupyter Notebook environment (e.g., Google Colab, JupyterLab).

Steps to Run the Code:

Load the dataset into a DataFrame.
Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
Train the Naive Bayes model on the training data.
Predict outcomes on the test data.
Evaluate model accuracy and print a detailed classification report.
Output:

Accuracy: 76.62%
