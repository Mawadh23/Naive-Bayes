# Naive-Bayes
Project Overview:
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of Naive Bayes classification using a dataset. The goal is to predict outcomes based on the input features provided in the dataset.

Included Files:
 • naive_bayes_classification.ipynb: A notebook containing Python code that loads the dataset, trains a Naive Bayes model, and evaluates its performance using accuracy and classification metrics.

Dataset:
The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset was used, which is available on Kaggle (link: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset).

How to Use:
 1. Install Required Libraries:
Make sure to install the necessary libraries by running the following command:

pip install pandas scikit-learn

 2. Running the Naive Bayes Code:
You can run it in any environment (such as Google Colab or JupyterLab).
 3. Steps to Run the Code:
 • Load the dataset into a DataFrame.
 • Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
 • Train the Naive Bayes model on the training data.
 • Predict outcomes on the test data.
 • Evaluate model accuracy and print a detailed classification report.

Output:
 • Accuracy: 76.62%
